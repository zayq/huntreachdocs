## 🏷️ What is a tag on HuntReach?

**Tags** are custom attributes associated with your contacts.  
They help you:

- Segment your lists
- Precisely target your campaigns
- Analyze performance by group

> 🧠 Tags are **not dynamic**: you can't use them as variables in your emails (`{{name}}`). They're meant for **segmentation and analysis**, not content personalization.

## ✍️ Creating tags in a Google Sheets or Excel file

### Step 1: Recommended file structure

| Email           | Position | Industry   | City          | TAGS                           |
| --------------- | -------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| elon@tesla.com  | CEO      | Automotive | San Francisco | CEO, Automotive, San Francisco |
| jeff@amazon.com | Founder  | E-commerce | Seattle       | Founder, E-commerce, Seattle   |

> ✅ **Best practices**:
>
> - Prefer descriptive tags like `CEO, E-commerce` instead of just `Yes/No`
> - All tags should be in a single cell, separated by commas

---

### Step 2: Automatically generate tags

In Google Sheets, insert this formula in the `TAGS` column:

Then **copy and paste values** to freeze the content:

- `Ctrl + Shift + V` (Google Sheets)
- `Paste special > Values` (Excel)

---

### Step 3: Export as CSV

- **Google Sheets**: `File → Download → .csv`
- **Excel**: `File → Save As → CSV (UTF-8)`

---

## 📤 Import your file into HuntReach

1. Go to [HuntReach Contacts](https://app.huntreach.com/dashboard/contacts)
2. Create a new list
3. Import your `.csv` file:
   - Make sure the email column is named **`email`** or **`e-mail`**
4. Review the preview
5. Click on **"Import Data"**

> **"Contacts successfully added to the list!"**
