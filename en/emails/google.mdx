## 🔗 Step 1: Sign In to Your Gmail Account

### How to sign in to Gmail:

## 📝 Step 2: Enable IMAP on Gmail

To allow HuntReach to access your Gmail account, it’s crucial to **enable IMAP**. This protocol lets third-party apps sync your emails without deleting them from the server.

### 📌 What is IMAP?

IMAP (_Internet Message Access Protocol_) allows your email client to access messages directly on the server, unlike **POP3**, which downloads and deletes them.

### 🚀 Why enable IMAP?

HuntReach uses IMAP to retrieve and manage your emails without interfering with your inbox.

### ✅ How to enable IMAP on Gmail:

1. **Go to Gmail settings**:
   - Click the gear icon in the top-right corner.
   - Select **"See all settings"**.
2. **Open the "Forwarding and POP/IMAP" tab**.
3. **Enable IMAP**:
   - Under **"IMAP access"**, select **"Enable IMAP"**.
   - Click **"Save Changes"**.

> 🎉 Once completed, IMAP is successfully enabled!

## 🔐 Step 3: Enable Two-Factor Authentication on Your Gmail Account

To secure your account, it’s recommended to **enable two-factor authentication (2FA)**. This layer of security is required to connect Gmail to HuntReach.

### 🔑 How to enable 2FA:

1. **Access your Gmail account**.
2. **Go to this link**:  
   👉 [Enable Two-Step Verification](https://myaccount.google.com/signinoptions/two-step-verification)
3. **Enable two-factor authentication**:
   - In the **"Signing in to Google"** section, click **"2-Step Verification"**.
   - Follow the steps to activate it.
4. **Set your verification method**:
   - Choose between **SMS, an authenticator app (like Google Authenticator), or a physical security key**.

## 🔑 Step 4: Create and Activate an App Password for Gmail

HuntReach cannot use your main Gmail password. **Google requires an app-specific password** to ensure secure connections.

### 🎯 How to create an app password:

1. **Go to Google App Passwords**:  
   👉 [Generate an app password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
2. **Select the app and device**:
   - Choose **"Mail"** in the dropdown menu.
   - Select **"Other (Custom name)"**, and name it something like **"HuntReach"**.
3. **Generate the password** and **save it securely**.
   - **Important**: This password **will only be shown once**!

> 🔐 **Store your app password securely**, as it cannot be retrieved later.
